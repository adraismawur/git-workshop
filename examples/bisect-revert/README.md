# Bisect-revert

In this example, you will find a commit that introduced a mistake in this branch using ```git bisect```, and then revert it using ```git revert```.

First start by typing ```git bisect start```.
You will now be able to tell git what is a good commit, and what is a bad commit.

Unless you know what the last good commit was, the easiest way to start is to just take the beginning of this branch.

You can find the hash of the first commit in this branch by using e.g. ```git log --pretty=oneline```.
This prints all the commits made in this branch, one per line, in a nice format that you can scroll up and down in using the arrow keys or pageup/pagedown.

If you do, you will find the hash ```9bb31ad854f70102826c8c804ec0d83abf0d21e7``` at the bottom.
You don't need to use the full hash, you can instead type in ```git bisect good 9bb31```

Since you are currently on a bad commit, you can set the current commit to bad.
Again you can use ```git log``` to view the hash of the latest commit. This should be ```bc7a776d0aad2348fe2a70025d789c9bc88a11a0```.

Again, no need for the full thing.
Type in ```git bisect bad bc7a7```.

Git bisect will now start the bisecting process.
You should see something like this:

```
Bisecting: 59 revisions left to test after this (roughly 6 steps)
[b147187186e27d31cd488d1bad4370888386c285] Morbi mollis felis sed tortor blandit finibus
```

Look at the bottom of this readme, is the dog there?
If so, type ```git bisect bad```.
If not, type ```git bisect good```.

Bisect will report how many commits are approximately left to check:
```
Bisecting: 3 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)
[78697b30ac0da558357b1cc84f8d506062f8d8bb] Donec rutrum urna gravida turpis vehicula, a rhoncus dui congue
```

When bisect has found your bad commit, it will show something like this:

```
[hash] is the first bad commit
commit [hash]
Author: Arjan Draisma <arjan.draisma@wur.nl>
Date:   [time]

    [message]

You can view the process using ```git bisect log```

Take note of the bad commit hash!

Now all there is left to do is to get rid of this commit, which is done simply by typing:

```git revert [hash]```

This will generate a commit for you:

```
Revert "[message]"

This reverts commit [hash].

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch examples/bisect-revert
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   examples/bisect-revert/README.md
#
```

Accept this commit, and you're done!

Once you are done, check out the main branch by typing ```git checkout main``` in a command line.


Nothing weird here yet!
